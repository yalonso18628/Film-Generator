# Film-Generator
Random film generator ðŸŽ¥

Love using apps like Letterboxd and Must for the films I want to watch. But I wish these apps could generate a random movie for me to watch from my "want" list. So I made a simple program that does that. 

Got this idea after taking a brief specialization course in Python from the University of Michigan. This was done mainly to practice basic coding as well as the use of databases such as SQLite. 

User has four options:
1) Add Film
  - User inputs film title and director. 
2) View List
  - Program spits out the move list in alphabetical order for the director. This was
    done in order for me to get used to remembering films by their directors.
3) Random Film
  - This generates the random film for the user and erases it from the database. 
4) Exit Application
  - Exits the Python application.

Future goals:
- As of now the user must input everything manually, hoping to learn a bit more about
  web-scraping and having the program read from a users specific list.
